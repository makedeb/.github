<h2>makedeb</h2>

Welcome! This is the organization for **makedeb**, a new packaging system that's designed to rework how people package their applications for Debian and Ubuntu based distributions, by making it simpler, more enjoyable, and ultimately more maintainable.

Besides makedeb itself, we also have some other noteworthy products, including:

- The [MPR](https://mpr.makedeb.org), a package repository for programs to use with makedeb.
- The [Prebuilt-MPR](https://docs.makedeb.org/prebuilt-mpr), a prebuilt repository for packages from the MPR.
- [Mist](https://github.com/makedeb/mist), the official command-line interface for interacting with the MPR.

### Contributing
We're getting better every day, and there's always some stuff that needs to be worked on. If you're a new contributor looking to help with the coding side of things, consider looking at the [documentation](https://docs.makedeb.org/support/ways-to-support-makedeb/#contribute-code) for ways you can contribute. If you'd like to help out in other ways, you can help others in the [support rooms](https://docs.makedeb.org/support/obtaining-support/), [package for the MPR](https://docs.makedeb.org/using-the-mpr/uploading-packages/), or [help with translations](https://docs.makedeb.org/support/ways-to-support-makedeb/#translating).
